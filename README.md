The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank's (SAIL) has a strict "File Out" policy to prevent patient identification and ensure compliance with SAIL policies. This means that for some experiments a complete experimental code pipeline may not be available. For further information please refer to SAIL's output review policy: https://saildatabank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/SAIL-POL-024-Output-Review-Policy-v1.2-3.pdf
